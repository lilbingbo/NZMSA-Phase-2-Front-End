YAHAHA! You found my web app! 

For this project, I created the Hyrule Compendium Search, which allows users to look up items from my favorite game, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 

The app calls on the Hyrule Compendium API:
https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/?id=demo

You can try searching for a cucco, windcleaver, bokoblin, or any other item found in the Hyrule Compendium API. 

I then deployed my app via netlify:
